> Push your changes to remote

git add -A (add all of the files)
git add /dir/file_name (add a specific file)

git commit -m 'with commit message'
git commit (then using vim to finish your commit message)

git push origin your_branch_name

> Get changes from remote

git pull (Usually use this. This should get all of the changes includes all of the remote branch and merge the remote code to your code)

Good to know:
git fetch (Get all of the code from remote but do not merge any changes to your code)
git rebase (don't ever try it :-) it will destroy everything! )

> Create a new branch
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git checkout new_branch_name (switch to another branch, but before that please use git status to confirm that you have commit all of your changes in this branch)
git branch -D bad_branch (delete a branch, but you cannot delete a branch you are currently on)
sorry.. I forget how to delete a remote branch... but definitely Github has a UI for it!

> Merge 2 branches
git merge branch1 (merge branch1â€™s code to current branch, usually merge master)

> if you pushed a wrong file
git revert

> if you add a wrong file
git reset file_name (not remember clearly)
